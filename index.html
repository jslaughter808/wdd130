            Hi! My name is Joseph Slaughter. I’m from California, and I’m balancing school and work
            while
            building skills in web development.
            My wife and I recently had a son, James, who is now 10 months old and trying to learn
            how to walk!
            I enjoy spending time with my family, playing hockey, and learning new tech. I’m excited
            to use
            this course to get better at building clean, simple websites.
