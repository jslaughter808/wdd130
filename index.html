            Hi! My name is Joseph Slaughter. I’m from California, and I’m balancing school and work
            while
            building skills in web development.
            My wife and I recently had a son, James, who is now 10 months old and trying to learn
            how to walk!
            I enjoy spending time with my family, playing hockey, and learning new tech. I’m excited
            to use
            this course to get better at building clean, simple websites.
        </p>

            My wife and I currently live in Utah where we have been studying and working for the
            past few years. It is a beautiful place filled with mountainous wildlife and so many
            activities, so there is always something to do!
